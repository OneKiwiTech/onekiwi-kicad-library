Fast forward to the invention of a proven, proprietary technology and more than 40 patents later, and we still do. This progress led to our new name - Helix Semiconductors - and we feel it truly represents the core of our company. We like to say that efficiently powering the future is in our DNA.\n\nNecessity is the mother of invention, and our MuxCapacitor® technology is our answer to address the shortcomings of the status quo. It converts mains power worldwide to virtually any lower voltage with more than 95% efficiency – and also enables true zero power. Waste not, want not.\n\nTrue change is on the horizon.

The company's full complement of resistor construction includes wirewound, wire element, thick film, and ceramic composition.\nOhmite Manufacturing Company started operations in a small shop on the west side of Chicago in 1925. Founded by David T. Siegel, the company's focus was to manufacture carbon and wire wound 'lug' resistors for Chicago's growing radio manufacturing industry. As the electronics industry grew and continued to develop, Ohmite continued evolving to service ever changing design requirements. In 1953, the company moved into a newly built factory and offices in Skokie, Illinois.",

In 1975 we made another technical cooperation with an American company named Kidco forgetting how to make 1% tolerance of precision metal film resistors. In 1985, we developed resistor network and fusible resistors; SMD components of chip resistors and chip resistor networks were marketed in 1992.

Relative to the hydraulic machine and mechanical presses, the Yangtze River Micro Technology servo-driven pressure of the integrated inductor each one is 5 times the mechanical press, hydraulic press 10 times. Each one molded inductor ensures zero defects.\nIn 2014, Cheung Kong Microelectronics introduced the world's thinnest 0.8MM thickness of the inductor to meet the ultra-thin handheld device needs. In the same year, the company officially launched the 2016 ultra-small inductor.",
